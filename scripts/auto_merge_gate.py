"""Decides whether a pull request's head commit is green enough to auto-merge.

Reads the commit's check runs and its combined commit status (as the GitHub REST API returns
them) and prints one word:

- `merge`: every check run has finished green (success, neutral or skipped), at least one
  succeeded, and no commit status is pending or failed;
- `wait`: something is still running, or nothing has reported yet;
- `stop`: something failed; a person looks at it.

Usage: python3 auto_merge_gate.py CHECK_RUNS_JSON COMBINED_STATUS_JSON
CHECK_RUNS_JSON is a JSON array of check runs; COMBINED_STATUS_JSON is the object from
`GET /repos/{repo}/commits/{sha}/status`. Prints names and conclusions only, never titles.

After a merge: python3 auto_merge_gate.py --issues-to-close REFS_JSON OWNER/REPO
REFS_JSON is the PR's `closingIssuesReferences` (from `gh pr view --json`); prints the
issue numbers in OWNER/REPO to close, one per line. A merge made with GITHUB_TOKEN does not
apply closing keywords, so the workflow closes them itself.
